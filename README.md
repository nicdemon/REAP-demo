### Project description

Demo of the REAP data visualization R Shiny app developped for the Falcone Lab at Montreal's Clinical Research Institute.

### Tabs descriptions

| Tab | Description |
|:--- |:----------- |
| Molecules query | Query molecules from the analysis, choose a patient and it's visits, possibility to visualize by raw expression or the distribution across patients |
| Pre-rendered heatmaps | Heatmaps rendered from a molecules cocktail of interest, decided by the biologists |
| Heatmap builder | Interactively build a heatmap by choosing a number of molecules and patients to compare |

### Data

The data files contained in the `data` folder contain randomly generated numbers. For the BAFF molecule expression level bins (Low, Average, High), the random number ranges are based on the real data distributions observed in the original data.

The original data is the property of the Falcone Lab and cannot be used in this demo as it has not been published yet.
